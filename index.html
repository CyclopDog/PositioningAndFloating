    				<h2>The Theory of Inflation</h2>
    				<p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so 
						uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>
    				<div class="grid">
    					<div>
    						<img alt="universe" src="images/2-the-universe.png">
							<p><strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, 
								we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we 
								look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>

    					</div>
    					<div>
    						<img alt="time" src="images/3-time.png">
							<p><strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast 
								distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered 
								patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.</p>

    					</div>
    					<div>
    						<img alt="distant coffee" src="images/4-distant-coffee.png">
							<p><strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. 
								You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.</p>

    					</div>
    					<div>
    						<img alt="coffee everywhere" src="images/5-coffee-everywhere.png">
							<p><strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong>  Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar 
								coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, 
								you might want to look for another explanation.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<img alt="still time" src="images/6-still-time.png">
							<p><strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong>  There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place 
								to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, 
								all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<img alt="inflation" src="images/7-inflation.png">
							<p><strong>INFLATION</strong>  solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a 
								second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the 
								violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<img alt="fluctuation" src="images/8-fluctuation.png">
							<p><strong>FLUCTUATION</strong>  Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in 
								swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early 
								universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<img alt="expansion" src="images/9-expansion.png">
							<p><strong>EXPANSION</strong>  Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than 
								light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure 
								of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<img alt="coffee everywhere" src="images/5-coffee-everywhere.png">
							<p><strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong>  Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a 
								similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup
								 in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>

    					Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
					</p>
					<p>
					Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
					</p>
					<p>
					“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
					</p>
					<p>
					The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.
					</p>
					<p>
					“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.
					</p>
					<p>
					Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.
