						CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and 
						a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
						 world of known physics.

						 repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

    				<h2>The Theory of Inflation</h2>
    				<p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so 
						uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>
    				<div class="grid">
    					<div>
    						<img alt="universe" src="images/2-the-universe.png">
							<p><strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, 
								we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we 
								look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>

    					</div>
    					<div>
    						<img alt="time" src="images/3-time.png">
							<p><strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast 
								distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered 
								patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.</p>

    					</div>
    					<div>
    						<img alt="distant coffee" src="images/4-distant-coffee.png">
							<p><strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. 
								You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.</p>

    					</div>
    					<div>
    						<img alt="coffee everywhere" src="images/5-coffee-everywhere.png">
							<p><strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong>  Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar 
								coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, 
								you might want to look for another explanation.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<img alt="still time" src="images/6-still-time.png">
							<p><strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong>  There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place 
								to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, 
								all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<img alt="inflation" src="images/7-inflation.png">
							<p><strong>INFLATION</strong>  solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a 
								second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the 
								violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<img alt="fluctuation" src="images/8-fluctuation.png">
							<p><strong>FLUCTUATION</strong>  Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in 
								swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early 
								universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<img alt="expansion" src="images/9-expansion.png">
							<p><strong>EXPANSION</strong>  Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than 
								light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure 
								of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<img alt="coffee everywhere" src="images/5-coffee-everywhere.png">
							<p><strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong>  Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a 
								similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup
								 in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>
